1. Shoutcast2... which you maybe know enought, because you work on this
2. Icecast2...which is also famous server type... http://adas.datalight.hu:8430/status.xsl
3. Or a 3rd server type called CAST, which is an Icecast2 based server but more quicker and easier solution... some stations use this, because the stability is better than Icecast 2... this works like this:
http://adas3.allinparty.hu:8430/status-json.xsl (we use this... so it would be cool to work with this ;)
4. And of course the icecast1 and simple shoutcast servers.
