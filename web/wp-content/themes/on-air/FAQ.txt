Please:
1. download the latest version of the theme from themeforest
2. update it online via FTP replacing the old one
3. unzip the theme folder in your pc (or mac)
4. go to slam/plugin/tgm
5. copy the plugins folder which are zipped in there to your desktop
6. delete the plugins revolution slider and ajax revslider from your site
7. install the ones that are on your desktop, extracted from the theme

As the issue comes from outdated versions, this should solve.

If you still have the problem, sometimes is caused from slow/cheap servers, to
solve it:

1. install w3 total cache
2. enable page and database cache (not other features)
3. retry 

this will solve the issue when caused by timeout from the server which sometimes
can happen.
